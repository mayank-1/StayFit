# Social Health Tracking System - StayFit
This is a mobile Application which is based on monitoring the calorie intake of the user. 
User can also count their steps while walking or running through this application. 
And one more thing during a workout or activity, if the user want to search for the nearby places then it's also possible.

I am making my college project open source. So you can use it by forking it.
